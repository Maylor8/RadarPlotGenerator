# RadarPlotGenerator
A tool used for generating radar plots to assist with the interpretation of accelerometry data, as described in [Rowlands et al. (2019)](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-019-0225-9)


# Getting started
For easy use of RadarPlotGenerator, a basic understanding of R programming language is desirable, but not essential. It is likely that the user will posses some knowledge having used the functionality in R package [GGIR](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR) to generate the Mx metric data that is plotted in the graph. Where this is not the case, the author has attempted to annotate the steps throughout to guide the user.
